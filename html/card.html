                Always bursting with energy, this little guy is either busy "hiding" his toys all over the place for his humans to find, or chasing Shaq around the house. He's our little chaotic fuzzball and we love him!

                Shaq came to us during the beginning of the pandemic. He is a little anxious at times, but he's the most loving cat uncle our fosters could ever wish for. And if anything ever displeases him, he will make very loudly sure that you know!
